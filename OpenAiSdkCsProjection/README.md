## Summary

This projection library is only required to generate C# projection (with [C#/WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT)) from C++/WinRT components, so it can be consumed from WinUI 3 C# applications with [Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/).
